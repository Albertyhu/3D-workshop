The page that contains the cube that animates on scroll is located at
./src/ScrollSnapCSS/ScrollSnappingPage_2.js

You just need to replace the child of the 'FixedElement' div.

notes 9/16/22
Making the main element's position sticky doesn't work well as it 
only stays in its parent div

read this about scroll-to-fix elements ;

How to make it work: 
Define a CSS class where the 'position' is fixed and the 'top' property
is defined. 
Use an event listener to listen to scroll event of the div element
where the scroll is happening. In the case of this project, the scrolling
is not the default option where it is done on the body element.
Instead, it is done on the 'MainContainer' div.

Lessons learned: 
The scroll snap type property does not work in react. 
I have to install a dependency scroll-snap to create the snapping feature.

update: 
I did manage to get the CSS scroll-snap-type property to work
The react scroll snap library however did not work well.
